#### OVERVIEW

**Site-to-Site VPN with BGP and Redundancy** is a secure, flexible, and highly available connectivity solution between AWS infrastructure and on-premises environments (or between two separate cloud environments).  
This solution leverages the power of **IPSec VPN**, the **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)**, and **redundancy mechanisms** to ensure continuous connectivity, even in the event of a link or tunnel failure.

The architecture is built upon the following core components:

- **AWS Virtual Private Gateway (VGW)** or **AWS Transit Gateway (TGW)**: The AWS endpoint for managing VPN connections and routing.
- **Customer Gateway (CGW)**: The device or software on the on-premises side that serves as the counterpart to the AWS gateway.
- **IPSec Tunnels**: Two secure tunnels for each VPN connection, operating in parallel to provide fault tolerance.
- **BGP**: A dynamic routing protocol that automatically updates route tables, minimizing downtime during network changes or failures.
- **Redundancy & Failover**: Mechanisms that automatically reroute traffic when a tunnel or network path becomes unavailable.

**Key benefits of the solution:**
1. ðŸ”’ **High Security** â€“ Uses IPSec encryption to protect data during transit.
2. âš¡ **Automated Route Updates** â€“ BGP dynamically propagates network changes without manual intervention.
3. ðŸ”„ **Flexible Redundancy** â€“ Two tunnels per VPN connection, with the ability to scale to multiple VPN links for improved resilience.
4. ðŸ“ˆ **Scalability** â€“ Easily extend connectivity to new sites or subnets without extensive reconfiguration.
5. ðŸ’° **Cost Optimization** â€“ Reduces dependency on expensive leased lines by leveraging existing internet infrastructure.

**Common deployment scenarios:**
- Connecting an **AWS VPC** to an on-premises data center for ERP or CRM workloads.
- Real-time data synchronization between distributed infrastructures.
- Supporting **Hybrid Cloud** or **Multi-Cloud** architectures.
- Implementing **Disaster Recovery (DR)** with automatic failover capabilities.

In this workshop, we will walk through the complete process of **designing, deploying, testing, and monitoring** a Site-to-Site VPN with BGP and Redundancy, including:
- Designing a **highly available architecture**
- Configuring **BGP Routing**
- Deploying **multiple tunnels**
- Setting up **automatic failover**
- Integrating **monitoring and troubleshooting**
- Implementing **cost optimization**
- Performing **security compliance checks**
- Building an **operational runbook and documentation**
